# Port configuration
# ==================
# The port where nginx will listen for HTTPS connections (default: 443)
nginx_frontend_port: 443

# The backend port where AAP gateway is running (default: 8501)
# If modify_envoy is true, AAP will be moved to this port
# If modify_envoy is false, this should match where AAP is currently running
aap_backend_port: 8501

# Envoy modification control
# ===========================
# Set to true to automatically reconfigure AAP's envoy to use aap_backend_port
# Set to false if AAP is already running on aap_backend_port OR if you want nginx
# to proxy to AAP on its current port (typically 443)
#
# USE CASE 1 (modify_envoy: true):
#   - AAP currently on 443 → move to 8501
#   - nginx takes over 443 → proxies to 8501
#   - Best for brownfield environments with AAP already on 443
#
# USE CASE 2 (modify_envoy: false):
#   - AAP stays on its current port (set aap_backend_port to match)
#   - nginx uses nginx_frontend_port for SSL termination
#   - Useful if you want to keep AAP port unchanged
